# 🌐 Web Development Learning Journey
Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the web. This repository is part of my learning journey into web development. I'm new to all of this, and I'm using this space to practice, experiment, and (hopefully) grow my skills over time.

# 📚 What to Expect
Since I'm still learning, this repo may contain:

- Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects
- Notes or code snippets from tutorials
- Small experiments and mini-projects
- Lots of trial and error 😊

Feel free to explore, learn along with me, or even drop a tip if you see something I can improve!

# 🚧 Disclaimer
This code might not follow best practices (yet!), and it’s here mainly for educational purposes. As I learn more, I’ll come back and improve things.

Thanks for stopping by!
